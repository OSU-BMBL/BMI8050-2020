What is the input size of the first layer?
1. The number of nodes
2. The number of features
3. The number of edges
4. The number of training_labels

Why adding self-connections in adjacency matrix?
1. To prevent overfitting
2. To increase training performaces
3. To learn node's own feature
4. To speed up the training time

Is there an overfitting issue in our model? Why?
1. No, because the loss keeps decreasing.
2. No, because the ROC keeps decreasing.
3. Yes, because the loss keeps decreasing.
4. Yes, because the ROC keeps decreasing.
